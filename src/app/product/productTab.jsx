            Fresh farm vegetables carefully selected and delivered with quality
            assurance. Sensory Experience Sight: A colorful circle with browned
            crust, red sauce, white/golden cheese, and vibrant toppings, often
            with bubbly, charred spots. Smell: Aromatic blend of baked dough,
            herbs (oregano, basil), savory cheese, and garlic. Touch: The warmth
            of the slice, the soft dough, gooey cheese, and crisp edges. Taste:
            A balance of salty, savory, sweet (from tomatoes), and sometimes
            spicy or tangy flavors. Sound: The slight crunch of the crust, the
            satisfying "tear" as you pull a slice.
